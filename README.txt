This is a project in java that requires quite a bit of computation. It reads a text file that contains the lattitudes and the longitude coordinates of all the roads and intersections in New York State.
There is a GUIfor the maps that shows all the roads and intersections. 
It then implements the Djikstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path between two points. 

To build the program, simply compile Main.java and run it. 

Build instructions:

Open the terminal on the folder with all the project files. Then run:
javac Main.java

Then enter:
java Main
