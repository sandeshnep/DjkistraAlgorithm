Overview:
I had the maps print out fine. I really struggled to make the Dijkstra's algorithm work. Even after multiple days of work, I wasn't
able to correctly implement it. Right now it gives wrong roads and intersections which are printed out in the console. Please check 
the paint method in the Main class to see it in action. Please consider my code and all the effort I put into it. 

The paint method has a method that takes in String ID of two points and computes the paths. 

Additionally, I put citations for the code that I reffered to as comments on the code itself. Please email me if you have any questions.
